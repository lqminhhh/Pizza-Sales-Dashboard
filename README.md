# Pizza-Sales-Dashboard

## 1. Introduction
This project is about reporting pizzas sales in 2015 using Tableau dashboard and SQL queries. First, I will design and develop a comprehensive Tableau dashboard that showcase sales performance, ordering trends, and areas for bussiness to improve. Then, I will use SQL queries using Azure Data Studio to validate the results obtained from the dashboard to ensure data accuracy and consistency.

## 2. Result

General guideline of the [dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/minh.le1509/viz/PizzaSalesDashboard_17050765040170/HomePage):
- The dashboard can be filtered by dates and by categories of the pizza.
- The *Home Page* sheet shows the sales performance and ordering trends of the customers
- The *Second Page* sheet demonstrates the best and worse pizza by quantities, orders, and revenues.
